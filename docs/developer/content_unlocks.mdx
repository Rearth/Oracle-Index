title: Content Progression System

Oracle index also has a feature where content needs to be unlocked before the player can access it. Locked pages are presented in an obfuscated manner, and won't appear in the search.
If all entries of a folder are locked, the entire folder will be hidden.

<Callout variant="warning">
    This feature is obviously only available in the in-game wiki, not the online wiki. The main target audience here are modpack makers that don't want to reveal everything at once.
</Callout>

To control unlocks, the frontmatter of the page needs an *unlock* section. This can look as follow:

```
---
title: Ingame Mod View Setup
unlock: advancement:minecraft:oritech/pulverizer
---
"unlock" is always the same
"advancement" is the name of the progress validator
anything after the "advancement:" part is passed to the validator
```

# Validators
Modders can register custom validator to the **Oracle Progress API**. Consult the javadocs of the API class for more details.

Oracle index does not store which entries have been unlocked, and will just call the validators on demand.

## Advancement Validator
By default only one validator is included with the mod: The advancement validator. It checks if a player has a specific advancement completed to view the page.
